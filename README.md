# Key Findings:
- The best GPUs (looking at 3DMARK & VRAM) are expensive
- 2022 had the highest average price (both retail and used) of GPUs
- 2024 sold the most GPUs
- The GPU specs are so similar to each other they're almost identical (Multicollinearity)
- The dataset is not normally distributed

# Business Problem
During planning, I brainstormed a few questions that I wanted answers to based on the data. These questions guides the analysis methods and visualizations.</br>

My Questions:
- What is the prices of the best GPUs? (price vs performance)
- What is the average cost of GPUs?
- What period of time did most people buy a GPU?
- Does retail price affect second hand price?
- What would future prices of the best GPU look like?
</br>

# Data Source
Free Dataset from Kaggle, published by Mann Acharya.

</br>

# Methods
## Data Cleaning Pipeline
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize the data
- Deal with null or blank values
- Change format of Date column
</br>

## Statistical Methods
- Correlation
- Descriptive Statistics (count, mean, median, mode, std, min, max & percentiles)
- Testing Multicollinearity
    - Variance Inflation Factor
    - Tolerance, Eigenvalues
    - Condition Index
- Testing Normality
    - Shapiro-Wilk Test
    - Skewness and Kurtosis
</br>

# Tech Stack
Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib
</br>

# Quick glance at the results

</br>

# Lessons learned and recommendation
I learned which library is best for visualizations in jupyter notebook, how to pick different graphs to display certain results and how to execute more advanced statistic techniques using python.

Recommendations: Use ridge regression to combat the multicollinearity problem 
</br>

# Limitations and what can be improved
My lack of knowledge in data science topics limited me on how much of my statistical knowledge that could be used in this project.

*Note: All data science techniques I've used in this project with python is self-taught

Some improvements:
- Using the gpu specifications (3DMARK, VRAM, Wattage) as categorical variables
- Redo the advanced statistics so I can create a forecasting model of future GPUs or comparison model for  prices
